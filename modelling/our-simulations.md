<h3>Our simulations</h3>
<p>The main PRIMAVERA simulations are conducted following the CMIP6 HighResMIP protocol.</p>
<p>A coordinated set of experiments has been designed to assess both a standard and an enhanced horizontal-resolution simulation in the atmosphere and ocean.</p>
<p>The experiments are divided into 3 tiers consisting of atmosphere-only and coupled runs and spanning the period 1950-2050, with the possibility of extending to 2100, together with some additional targeted experiments. (<a href="http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/4185/2016/">View scientific article by Haarsma et al., 2016</a>&nbsp;for more detail)</p>
<p>These simulations will also serve as a more reliable source for assessing climate risks that are associated with small-scale weather phenomena such as tropical cyclones, and are part of the CMIP6 model intercomparison exercise (See <a href="https://hrcm.ceda.ac.uk/research/cmip6-highresmip/" title="HighResMIP home page">HighResMIP home page</a> for more detail).</p>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the various model simulations undertaken and their particularities.</p>
