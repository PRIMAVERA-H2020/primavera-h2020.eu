<p>PRIMAVERA is structured in 11 work packages, outlined below.</p>

<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Develop process-based metrics to assess the impact of model improvements in the atmosphere (including those related to the changes in atmospheric composition), ocean, land, cryosphere, and the interactions between the different components, with special emphasis on the simulation of the European climate</li>

<ul>
<li>Provide a systematic assessment of the benefits of simultaneously increased atmospheric and oceanic resolutions and increased atmospheric resolution only in global coupled climate models for processes affecting European climate and its variability</li>

<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improve understanding of the key oceanic physical and dynamical drivers and mechanisms leading to decadal variability of European climate</li>
<li>Assess the influences of regional climate phenomena such as the summer Arctic sea ice decline and Siberian autumn snow cover reduction on the decadal variability of European climate</li>
<li>Quantify the respective influence of oceanic modes and anthropogenic direct radiative factors for both recent observed (1979-2014) and near-future (2015-2034) atmospheric and continental changes in European climate</li>
<li>Assess the robustness of European climate responses to the range of considered drivers to atmospheric and oceanic model resolution as well as physics</li>
</ul>
