<h3>Research themes</h3>
<p>PRIMAVERA is organised around five major research themes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Innovations in Modelling</li>
<li>Process-based Assessment</li>
<li>Drivers of European Climate</li>
<li>Flagship Simulations for CMIP6</li>
<li>Climate Risk Assessment</li>
</ol>
<p>The themes will interact strongly and follow an iterative workflow. The science themes (1, 2, 3) will primarily use simulations of theme 4. Theme 5 will ensure robust interpretation of the scientific risks for policy and other users, as well as engaging specific end-users in the co-design of climate scenarios.</p>
<p>The project will build on European research experience, for example using High Performance Computing developed in other projects (PRACE-UPSCALE, Athena), coordinated via the <a href="https://is.enes.org/">IS-ENES2</a> project on infrastructure development. It will make coordinated use of European high-resolution GCMs to generate projections to 2050.</p>
