<p>PRIMAVERA is a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/" title="Horizon 2020 website">Horizon 2020</a> project funded by European Commission. The project is a collaboration between 19 European partners, led by the Met Office and the Reading University in the UK.</p>
<h3>Period</h3>
<p>PRIMAVERA started in November 2015 with a kick-off meeting held jointly with the <a href="https://crescendoproject.eu/">CRESCENDO project</a>. The project runs until July 2020.</p>
<h3>Aim</h3>
<p>Its aim is to develop a new generation of advanced and well-evaluated high-resolution global climate models, capable of simulating and predicting regional climate with unprecedented fidelity, for the benefit of governments, business and society in general.</p>
<p>The results will help answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>To what extent are recent heat waves, floods and droughts in Europe attributable to natural variability or human influences on the global climate system?</li>
<li>How will the risk of such high impact climate and weather events change over the next few decades?</li>
</ul>
