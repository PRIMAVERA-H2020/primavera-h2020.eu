<h3>Advanced, high-fidelity models</h3>
<p>The concept of model fidelity* is central to PRIMAVERA, and its foundations are in understanding processes.</p>
<p>It is clear that many of the most pressing questions about regional climate change urgently require advances in the simulation of processes. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>To what extent are recent heat waves, floods and droughts in Europe attributable to natural variability or human influences on the global climate system?</li>
<li>How will the risk of such high impact events change over the next few decades and beyond?</li>
</ul>
<p>The extent to which it is possible to provide robust answers to these questions relies fundamentally on the fidelity of the climate models that are used to address them. However, fidelity is insufficient in itself: we must be able to  justify why a particular model produces a particular prediction at the process level.</p>
<p><em>* In this context, fidelity expresses the accuracy with which a numerical simulation captures the behaviour of the real world.</em></p>
<h3>Climate processes and high-resolution Global Climate Models (GCMs)</h3>
<p>Many years of experience, first in numerical weather prediction and, equally albeit only recently, in climate<br>simulation, have demonstrated that advances in the explicit simulation of key processes are essential to achieving<br>sustained progress and to provide robust answers.</p>
<p>High-resolution has been identified as one essential element of the development of GCMs to reproduce key climate processes with higher fidelity than conventional GCMs, thus enabling detailed process understanding.</p>
