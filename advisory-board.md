<h3>External Expert Advisory Board</h3>
<p>The <strong>External Expert Advisory Board (EEAB)</strong> is an independent group that was formally established by the Coordinators at the beginning of the project. The group consists of <strong>six experts in areas immediately relevant to PRIMAVERA</strong>.</p>
<p>They provide independent evaluation of the project work plan, progress and techniques, making recommendations for improvement on the project’s scientific approach and orientation where appropriate, ensuring scientific evaluation of the project and links to other programmes.</p>
<p>Consulting with the EEAB increases awareness of PRIMAVERA through the members’ involvement in communities such as IPCC, CMIP6, GEWEX, application of climate information, climate services (through EUPORIAS), and hence ensures that the project achieves maximum impact.</p>
<p>The EEAB is invited to attend each of the General Assembly meetings. The Coordinators also maintain more regular contact with the EEAB. The EEAB is routinely provided with information on project progress and results.</p>
<p><strong>Graeme Stephens, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, U.S.A.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Stephens/">Graeme Stephens</a> leads the international GEWEX global water and energy project and is a world-renowned expert in remote sensing, and the PI of a number of key satellite missions in the last two decades, e.g. CloudSat, which have revolutionised the way we assess GCMs.</p>

<p><strong>Masahide Kimoto, University of Tokyo, Japan</strong></p>
<p>Masahide Kimoto has extensive expertise in high resolution climate modelling and process-based assessment, and has played key roles in a number of past IPCC and CMIP programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Marta Bruno Soares, University of Leeds, U.K.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/1182/dr-marta-bruno-soares">Marta Bruno Soares</a> has expertise in end-user needs across different sectors, and works within FP7 EUPORIAS project for climate services.</p>

<p><strong>Christiane Jablonowski, University of Michigan, U.S.A.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~cjablono/">Christiane Jablonowski</a> is an expert in numerical methods and in atmospheric dynamics, particularly in the field of tropical cyclones. She is internationally recognised for her leading role in creating a number of novel, standardised tests for assessing current and next-generation dynamical cores – particularly those supporting the use of irregular and adaptive meshes – used in GCMs.</p>
